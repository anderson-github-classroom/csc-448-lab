# CSC 448 Template Lab

## Instructions
This is a blank repo containing information about working on and submitting your labs and assignments.

* The lab assignments are located in https://github.com/anderson-github-classroom/csc-448-student
* You will only need to clone csc-448-student repo once. Each week (or more frequent) you can issue a ``git pull`` and receive updated information.
* You should not make changes inside csc-448-student. It should be viewed as read only; however, if you do make changes, please copy/save them manually and then issue a ``git stash`` before trying ``git pull``.
* To work on your lab, click on the link in the schedule, accept the GitHub assignment which will create you an individual repo. It is in this individual repo where you will copy the lab assignment from csc-448-student. 
* When you are done with the lab (or whenever you want), add your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes.
